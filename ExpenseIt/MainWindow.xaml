<!--This app navigates to different content depending on the user input. This is why the main Window needs to be changed to a NavigationWindow. NavigationWindow inherits all the properties of Window. The NavigationWindow element in the XAML file creates an instance of the NavigationWindow class. For more information, see Navigation overview.
    
  This sets ExpenseItHome.xaml to be the first page opened when the application starts.
  You can also set the Source property in the Miscellaneous category of the Properties window.

    <NavigationWindow x:Class="ExpenseIt.MainWindow"
